# raizu

Nano HTTP web application framework that draws inspiration from Python Flask and Django.

Raizu works just like `net/http` with a few extra functions. It is designed to offer suggestions and default implementations, but doesn't enforce any specific dependencies or project layout.

Raizu provides configuration and conventions to get started and build reusable web applications.
